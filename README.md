# 🎓 Simulation of the DEPI System

This project is a *web application* that simulates the *post-acceptance phase* of the *Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)*.  
It was developed as part of the *Data Science track* with *EYouth* in the topic *Database with Python*.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The system is designed to manage different roles within DEPI, each with its own access level and control:

- *Student* 👨‍🎓  
- *Instructor* 👨‍🏫  
- *Coordinator* 👩‍💼  
- *Company* 🏢  
- *Ministry* 🏛  

This simulation helps visualize how the workflow and permissions are managed in real scenarios.
